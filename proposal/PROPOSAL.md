## Competing titles

1. _Title_, Author Name, 978-1-23456-789-0, Publisher, 20XX

This book is excellent for the _why_ and high-level principles but lacks any
practical, up-to-date technical implementation guide. Our book provides the
concrete _how_ with modern tools.

2. _Title_, Author Name, 978-1-23456-789-0, Publisher, 20XX

This is a great title but is now 10+ years old. It predates modern usage, and
the deep integration that is standard today. My book is its natural, modern
successor.

3. _Title_, Author Name, 978-1-23456-789-0, Publisher, 20XX

This is a good general introduction to the technologies but is not focused on
the specific architecture, patterns, and challenges of building and maintaining
a scalable solution.

## Book outline

> Include a detailed outline for the project here, following the example format below.

> Note: Each chapter will end with 3-5 questions, and the book will conclude
> with a 20-question Final Quiz unless otherwise agreed with your acquisitions
> editor. 
> (If proposing a second edition, please highlight changes from the previous
> edition.)

_FWIW I checked the 15 O'Reilly books I own and literally none of them close_
_each chapter with questions or end the book with a final quiz._

_That said, it's a good idea to include a brief interview with an expert at the_
_end of each chapter if possible._

_Use [OUTLINE.md](./OUTLINE.md) to nail down your outline then copy it from_
_there._
