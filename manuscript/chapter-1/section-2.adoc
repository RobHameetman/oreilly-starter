.List with explanation
- Item one::
  Explanation of item one that might span multiple lines
- Item two::
  Explanation of item two

=== Another Subsection

Include practical examples and code samples where appropriate:

.Simple code example
[source,python]
----
def example_function(param):
    """This is a docstring."""
    return param * 2
----

.For more complex examples, use a labeled listing
[[complex-example]]
.Complex code example with caption
[source,javascript]
----
// This is a more complex example
function complexExample(config) {
    const { param1, param2 } = config;
    
    return {
        result: param1 + param2,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };
}
