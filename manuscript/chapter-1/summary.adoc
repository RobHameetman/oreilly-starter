These sections are optional. In their proposal form, O'Reilly notes that "each
chapter will end with 3-5 questions, and the book will conclude with a
20-question Final Quiz unless otherwise agreed with your acquisitions editor."

I checked 15 O'Reilly books that I own and literally none of them have questions
at the end of each chapter or a final quiz. But if you need it you can add that
in here as well.

A good idea is to include a brief interview with an expert at the end of each
chapter if possible.
