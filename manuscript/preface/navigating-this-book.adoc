== Navigating This Book

This book is primarily organized in a topic-based format. As such, you may want
to jump into the specific topics that interest you the most. While I have done
my best to reference terms and ideas in the earlier chapters, I'd like to think
that even people who consider themselves fairly experienced will find something
of interest in all chapters here.

I would certainly suggest that you take a look at Chapter 1, which touches on
the breadth of the topic as well as providing some framing for how I go about
things in case you want to dive deeper into some of the later topics.

For people new to the subject, I've structured the chapters in a way that I hope
will make sense to read from beginning to end.

Here is an overview of what we'll cover:
