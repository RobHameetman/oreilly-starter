## Environment Setup

### Recommended Tools
- **Editor**: VS Code with AsciiDoc extension or IntelliJ with AsciiDoc plugin
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub or GitLab
- **Build Tools**: Ruby with AsciiDoctor gem for local previews
- **Diagramming**: Draw.io, Excalidraw, or PlantUML for technical diagrams

### Initial Setup
1. Install the AsciiDoctor processor: `gem install asciidoctor`
2. Install PDF support: `gem install asciidoctor-pdf`
3. Configure your editor with the settings from our `.editorconfig`
4. Set up the project structure using our template


## Writing Workflow

### Daily Writing Practice
1. **Start with outlines**: Use our outline template to plan each chapter
2. **Set word count goals**: Aim for 500-1000 words per writing session
3. **Write first, edit later**: Complete full sections before refining
4. **Regular commits**: Commit after completing each logical section

### Chapter Development Process
1. Create chapter file using our chapter template
2. Fill in metadata (learning objectives, prerequisites)
3. Write content in this order:
   - Introduction
   - Main concepts with examples
   - Practical applications/exercises
   - Conclusion
   - Review questions
4. Add cross-references to other chapters
5. Include code samples with proper licensing

### Technical Review Cycle
1. **Self-review**: Use our validation scripts before sharing
2. **Technical review**: Share with subject matter experts
3. **Copy editing**: Review for language and clarity
4. **Final proof**: Check formatting and cross-references


## Version Control Strategy

### Branch Organization
`main` -> production-ready content
`develop` -> integration branch
`feature/*` -> individual chapters or sections
`review/*` -> chapters under technical review
`fix/*` -> corrections and edits

### Commit Practices
- Use conventional commit messages:
  - `feat: add chapter on machine learning`
  - `fix: correct code sample in chapter 3`
  - `docs: update introduction section`
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages

### Tagging Releases
- Tag chapters when they complete technical review
- Tag full manuscript versions for editor submissions
- Use semantic versioning: `v1.0.0-chapter4`


## Review Process

### Technical Review Workflow
1. Create a review branch: `review/chapter-4`
2. Add reviewers as collaborators
3. Use GitHub issues for specific feedback points
4. Address feedback with separate commits
5. Merge back to develop when approved

### Editor Review
1. Export to PDF using our export script
2. Create a ZIP archive of manuscript and assets
3. Submit with changelog of updates since last submission
4. Track editor feedback in dedicated issues

### Continuous Integration
We provide GitHub Actions workflows that:
- Validate AsciiDoc syntax on pull requests
- Build PDF and HTML versions on changes to main
- Check for broken links and references
- Generate word count reports
